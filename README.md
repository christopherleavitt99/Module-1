# Overview

{Important! Do not say in this section that this is college assignment. Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

This software is too make a list andd enqueue and dequeue items in/out of it.

The purpose in creating this software is to show what I know about object oriented programming.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

VSCode was used to develop the software in C++. The language was pretty similar to C#, but it was a little different in how it is written.

# Future Work

- For some reason, the #include always had an error on it, especially for iostream. I sadly could not figure out the issue even when consoling the class.
